# Components

Reusable React components organized by purpose:

- `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, cards, inputs)
- `forms/` - Form-related components
- `charts/` - Data visualization components
- `layout/` - Shared layout components (header, sidebar, footer)

Keep components generic and reusable.
